// Sheet! 
// ======

// a sub-256b full-featured JS spreadsheet
// =======================================

// This app creates a spreadsheet of 4 x 6 cells supporting:
// - any value: text, number or float (ex: `Hi!` or `8` or `1.234`).
// - formulae (ex: `=A1+8`), visible when a cell is focused and executed on blur.
// - implicit `Math` in formulae (ex: `=sqrt(A1)`).
// - updates all the grid in cascade when a cell value changes.
// - protection against auto or circular references.
// - localStorage persistence.

//iframe {
//    display:block;
//    width:100%;
//}



// We start by declaring the function `o`. This function has two uses:
// - If it's called with an argument `b`, it will initialize and draw all the spreadsheet in HTML.
// - It it's called with no argument, it will evaluate all the cells and update their values.
o = b => {
  
  // This weird `for` statement is used to make a loop that iterates a lot of times, by using very few characters.
  // `{} + o` generates a 245-chars string containing the String value of `{}` ("[object Object]"),
  // followed by all the source code of `o`. ("b=>{for(i in{}+o) ... x-~x?+x:x)}").
  // Minified, `for(i in{}+o)` is 5 chars shorter than the equivalent `for(i=0;i<245;i++)`.
  // `i` is the loop var going from 0 to 245.
  for(i in {} + o){
  
    // All the following code is executed with `Math` implied.
    // This allows to call Math functions in formulae, without writing "Math.",
    // but the Math object (`M`) will also be used to store all the cells values before they're evaluated (especially the formulae).
    with(M = Math){
    
      // The string `y` represents the current cell's name.
      // It is built by concatenating the (i%5)'th char of 'ABCD',
      // and `-~(i/5%6)`, which is equivalent to `1 + Math.floor(((i / 5) % 6))` (this is needed to name the first line "1" instead of "0").
      // So in each loop, `y` gets a value from this list: "A1", "B1", "C1", "D1", NaN, "A2", "B2", ..., "C6", "D6", NaN, then it gets back to "A1" , "A2", ...
      // We then store data in `M[y]`, according to the value of `b`:
      M[yy = 'ABCDE'[i % 6] + -~(i / 6 % 10)] =
      
      // If `b` is set:
      b ?
      
      // We use the first 30 values of `y` to render the grid in HTML:
      document.write(
        
        (
        
          // If `y` is truthy and lower than 30:
          // (the limit of 30 ensures that the grid keeps a 6 cells + 6 line breaks)
          yy && i < 60
        
          // write the beginning of an <input> tag, with the attributes "placeholder" and "id" equal to `y`.
        
  //`<div id='container30'  style='border:3px solid gray;   position:absolute; height:200px;  width:300px; left:16px; top:200px;  z-index:1000'>

        ),
        
        // then write the end of the current tag, including two event listeners:
        //
        //  `onblur=l[id]=value;o()`:
        //  as soon as a cell loses focus,
        //  this event will store the value of the cell (`this.value`) in `l[this.id]` (`l` represents `localStorage`, and the  two `this` are implicit),
        //  then it will call the function `o()` with no argument to evaluate all the cells.
        //
        //  `onfocus=value=[l[id]]`:
        //  as soon as the cell is focused,
        //  this event will put the stored cell value (`l[this.id]`) in `this.value` (so the user can see his original formula).
        //  `l[this.id]` is surrounded by an array (`[]`) to avoid writing "undefined" when we focus an empty cell.
        //  indeed, the array `[undefined]` coerces into an empty string, which is what we want here (keep the empty cells empty on focus).

          // We eval the string `'x'+z`.
          // Ex: if the stored formula of A1 is "=A2+2", then we eval the string 'x=A2+2".
          // here, `A2` represents the value of the cell A2 which has been previously stored in `M`.
          // Indeed, if we consider the surrounding `with(M=Math)`, the string we execute is equivalent to 'x=M.A2+2'.
          // So, `x` contains the the saved value of `A2`, plus 2.
          // If A2 contains a number, it'll work instantly.
          // But if A2 contains a formula (for example "=A3+8", and A3 contains "5"), A1's `x` will not get its value instantly.
          // For the cell A1, the computed value of `x` will get a garbage value, but for A2, it will get computed fine as 5+8 = 13.
          // By chance, there are many "eval" passes on the grid's cells, and at the second pass, A1 will be evaluated correctly:
          // This time, 'x=M.A2+2' will now equal 'x=13+2' and `x` will contain the number 15.

        x - ~x ?
        // In this case, we store `+x` (similar to `parseFloat(x)`) in `M[y]`.
        +x
         // Else, if `x` contains text:
